Where is "ERROR 4: Unable to open EPSG support file gcs.csv" coming from and what does it mean?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The full message is "ERROR 4: Unable to open EPSG support file gcs.csv.  Try
setting the GDAL_DATA environment variable to point to the directory containing
EPSG csv files." The GDAL/OGR library prints this text to your process's stdout
stream when it can not find the gcs.csv data file it needs to interpret spatial
reference system information stored with a dataset. If you've never seen this
before, you can summon this message by setting GDAL_DATA to a bogus value in
your shell and running a command like ogrinfo:

.. code-block:: console

    $ GDAL_DATA="/lol/wut" ogrinfo example.shp -so example
    INFO: Open of 'example.shp'
          using driver 'ESRI Shapefile' successful.

    Layer name: example
    Geometry: Polygon
    Feature Count: 67
    Extent: (-113.564247, 37.068981) - (-104.970871, 41.996277)
    ERROR 4: Unable to open EPSG support file gcs.csv.  Try setting the GDAL_DATA environment variable to point to the directory containing EPSG csv files.

If you're using GDAL software acquired by a package management system like apt
or yum, or Homebrew, you can likely eliminate this message and the condition
that causes it by unsetting GDAL_DATA in your environment.

If you see this error message when using Rasterio in a Python program or when
using Rasterio's CLI in a shell script, the solution is to upgrade to version
1.0.18, which almost always sets GDAL_DATA when needed and otherwise leaves it
alone.
